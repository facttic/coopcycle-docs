# Configuration of your software

The cooperative which manages and uses the software can configure it according to its needs, with the page `Configuration > Parameters`.

It is possible to:
- Set a brand name which will be displayed in the header and in email signatures
- Set administrator's email address which notifications of new orders will be send to
- Indicate the latitude/longitude of your location in order to center the map on your area of operation
- Configure Stripe for credit card payments. For more information, take a look at the [Stripe documentation](/en/admin/stripe-payments.md)
